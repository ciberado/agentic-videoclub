/**
 * Conditional Routing Function - LangGraph Flow Control Logic
 * 
 * PURPOSE:
 * Implements the core conditional routing logic for the LangGraph workflow, determining
 * the next node to execute based on current state. This function serves as the "traffic
 * controller" that orchestrates the multi-step agent execution flow.
 * 
 * ROUTING DECISION MATRIX:
 * - END: Final recommendations available â†’ terminate workflow
 * - batch_control_and_routing_node: Quality gate passed OR max attempts reached
 * - movie_discovery_and_data_fetching_node: Continue search with new criteria
 * 
 * - Model: Claude 3 Haiku (fast decision-making for routing logic)
 * - Smart Routing: LLM-assisted path selection based on state analysis
 * - Predictive Routing: Anticipate optimal paths based on current progress
 * - Dynamic Flow: Modify routing rules based on user context and history
 * 
 * STATE VALIDATION:
 * - Input Validation: Ensure state contains required fields for routing decisions
 * - Consistency Checks: Validate state transitions are logically sound
 * - Error Detection: Identify corrupted or incomplete state scenarios
 * - Recovery Logic: Handle edge cases and unexpected state conditions
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - LangGraph Edges: Compatible with conditional edge definitions
 * - State Management: Works with modern Annotation.Root() state pattern
 * - Error Handling: Graceful handling of routing failures
 * - Logging Integration: Comprehensive decision tracking via Winston
 * 
 * EDUCATIONAL VALUE:
 * Demonstrates LangGraph conditional routing patterns, state-based decision making,
 * and the implementation of complex workflow control logic in AI agent systems.
